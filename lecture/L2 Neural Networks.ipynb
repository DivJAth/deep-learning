    "- An iteration of the algorithm above presents the entire training set to the learning algorithm. This is also known as an <i>epoch</i>. <i>Compute the total number of forward and back propagations as a function of the number of epochs and the size of the training set.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding more data can sometimes help to decrease the number of epochs, but whether this works depends on the kind of data provided as well as the architecture of the neural network. <i>Experiment with increasing the size of the training set. Are you able to improve prediction accuracy with lesser number of epochs for the XOR function?</i>"
